This is a simple application of Create - Read - Update - Delete in building a REST API using a mock data.

I created this simple application to serve as a guide when I'm building a routes for a web application.

For this application, I used Node.js, Express and Postman(for testing). All these routes were tested in POSTMAN and all are working as expected.
